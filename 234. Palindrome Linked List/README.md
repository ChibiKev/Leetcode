# 234. Palindrome Linked List
Difficulty: Easy

[Link To Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

## Problem
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return `true` *if it is a **palindrome** or* `false` *otherwise.*
- **palindrome** - A **palindrome** is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

## Examples
### Example 1:
![example1](./example1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```
### Example 2:
![example2](./example2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

## Follow Up:
- Could you do it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?
