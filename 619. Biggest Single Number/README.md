Difficulty: Easy

[Link To Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/biggest-single-number/)

## Problem
**SQL Schema**
```sql
Create table If Not Exists MyNumbers (num int)
Truncate table MyNumbers
insert into MyNumbers (num) values ('8')
insert into MyNumbers (num) values ('8')
insert into MyNumbers (num) values ('3')
insert into MyNumbers (num) values ('3')
insert into MyNumbers (num) values ('1')
insert into MyNumbers (num) values ('4')
insert into MyNumbers (num) values ('5')
insert into MyNumbers (num) values ('6')
```

Table: `MyNumbers`
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains an integer.
```

A **single number** is a number that appeared only once in the `MyNumbers` table.

Write an SQL query to report the largest **single number.** If there is no **single number,** report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example.

## Examples
### Example 1:
```
Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.
