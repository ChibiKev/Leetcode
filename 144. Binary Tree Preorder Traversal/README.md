# 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
Difficulty: Easy

[Link To Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

## Problem
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.*

## Examples
### Example 1:
![example1](./example1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints:
- The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Follow Up:
- Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
