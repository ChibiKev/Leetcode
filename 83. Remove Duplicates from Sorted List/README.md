Difficulty: Easy

[Link To Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

## Problem
Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, *delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once.* Return *the linked list **sorted** as well.*

## Examples
### Example 1:
![example1](./example1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```
### Example 2:
![example2](./example2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.
